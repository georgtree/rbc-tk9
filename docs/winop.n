.SH Description
.PP
The \fBwinop\fP command performs various window operations on Tk windows using low\-level Xlib function calls to work
around window manager pecularities.
.SH Introduction
.PP
Tk has several commands for manipulating its windows: \fBraise\fP, \fBlower\fP, \fBwm\fP, etc. These commands ask the window
manager to perform operations on Tk windows. In some cases, a particular window manager won't perform the operation as
expected.
.PP
For example, if you positioned a toplevel window using \fBwm geometry\fP, the window may not actually be at those
particular coordinates. The position of the window may be offset by dimensions of the title bar added by the window
manager.
.PP
In situations like these, the \fBwinop\fP command can be used to workaround these difficulties. Instead, it makes
low\-level Xlib (such \fBXRaiseWindow\fP and \fBXMapWindow\fP) calls to perform these operations.

The following operations are available for the \fBwinop\fP command:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop lower\fP ?\fIwindow\fP? ...
.RE
.IP
Lowers \fIwindow\fP to the bottom of the X window stack. \fIWindow\fP is the path name of a Tk window.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop map\fP ?\fIwindow\fP? ...
.RE
.IP
Maps \fIwindow\fP on the screen. \fIWindow\fP is the path name of a Tk window.  If \fIwindow\fP is already mapped, this command
has no effect.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop move\fP \fIwindow x y\fP
.RE
.IP
Move \fIwindow\fP to the screen location specified by \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP\&. \fIWindow\fP is the path name of a Tk window, while \fIx\fP and
\fIy\fP are screen coordinates. This command returns the empty string.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop raise\fP ?\fIwindow\fP? ...
.RE
.IP
Raises \fIwindow\fP to the top of the X window stack. \fIWindow\fP must be a valid path name of a Tk window. This command
returns the empty string.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop snap\fP \fIwindow photoName\fP
.RE
.IP
Takes a snapshot of the \fIwindow\fP and stores the contents in the photo image \fIphotoName\fP\&. \fIWindow\fP is the valid path
name of a Tk window which must be totally visible (unobscured). \fIPhotoName\fP is the name of a Tk photo image which must
already exist. This command can fail if the window is obscured in any fashion, such as covered by another window or
partially offscreen. In that case, an error message is returned.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop unmap\fP ?\fIwindow\fP? ...
.RE
.IP
Unmaps \fIwindow\fP from the screen. \fIWindow\fP is the path name of a Tk window.
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwinop warpto\fP ?\fIwindow\fP?
.RE
.IP
Warps the pointer to \fIwindow\fP\&. \fIWindow\fP is the path name of a Tk window which must be mapped. If \fIwindow\fP is in the
form \fI@x,y\fP, where \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are root screen coordinates, the pointer is warped to that location on the screen.
.IP
If no \fIwindow\fP argument is present the current location of the pointer is returned. The location is returned as a list
in the form "\fIx y\fP", where \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are the current coordinates of the pointer.
